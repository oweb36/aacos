The premise is that air conditioners are competing for something.  

That something, is a wired controller that can be placed on the wall. Why? Honestly IDK except for the fact that all of the people involved are for residential use.  

They are in some field for the competition. Bliss-like field? The important thing is that it has a lot of oil palm and coconut trees. Let's hope America won't invade them.
