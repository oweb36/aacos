PKAy, a contestant. His name is pronounced as Pee-Kay. Do not ask how PKH became PKA in my memory alright.

He is a Mitsubishi Electric (Mr. Slim) PKH-4FKSA. He is male. Born in 1997.

He can speak due to him not natively having a beep like his fellow people. He also has a beep, though its a composite beep.

[TBA PKAy personality. He is even older than most other AC. He is not that wise on guiding the outside, but he can guide the inside of you. ]
