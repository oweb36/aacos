### Basic identity
The characters of AACOS are Air Conditioners. They are people.  
The species of the characters is their model. They also have a subspecies, which is their BTU capability or fancy additions and things.  
The character's can't have sex or reproduce. They don't have the capability to do so.  

### Extended identity
They have sex identity. They also have Gender Identity.  
The information about their birth is the date when they are manufactured and is functional. Some or even all may be lost (We can't date them precisely), as we try to date them by reality (manuals, reviews or other content) to determine when they are possibly manufactured.  
The names of Air Conditioners are partly derived from their species/model.

### Abilities and quirks

The Air Conditioners can blow air. The air can be cold or heated. It can be blown up or down.  
They can also generate "ions" if they have the capability. It's dependent on their species/model. What "ions" they generate depends on their species too.  
The Air Conditioners can also walk. They aren't immobile and have limbs.  

They normally can only beep or make fancy sounds, not talk. This is due to their anatomy, which only allows beepers, or speakers in special cases. They and us viewers can understand each other. In some situations, their beep would be composite.  
However, if the AC does not have a beep of their own, their beep would be composite.
A beep is composite if the base beep edited with other sounds overlayed on top of it.  
In some case, an AC can talk with a human voice. This is normally the case when the AC does not have a beep of their own.

### Anatomy, injury and death
The anatomy of Air Conditioners is that they have a fan, swing, electronics control module, shell and evaporator.  
The shell is their body, or skin. The shell is made out of plastic, causing the Air Conditioners to be fragile especially to harsh forces like crushing, striking or drop damage. The limbs and faces of them are on their shell. Damage to those areas can cause disabilities.  
The evaporator is like their temperature regulation component. It also allows them to control the temperature of the air they blow.  
Their electronics control module, or logic board is their brain. This is where their soul are located. The soul is responsible for their memories and thinking power, and its indestructible.  
The fan is responsible for blowing the air out of the Air Conditioners.  
The swing is responsible for directing the air out of the Air Conditioners.  

Destruction or damage that is unrepairable renders the module non-functional and death to the Air Conditioner victim. If the module somehow becomes completely unusable and non-functional due to ROM corruption or something, the victim also dies. Repairable damage is the same as brain damage.  
The victim can die if they are destroyed physically. Air Conditioners will also die if they overheat (Their internals would melt and get fried), freeze to death (Their electronics control module would crack).  
Cracks and damages to their other parts are injuries.  
Cracks to their shell can also render their limbs unusable, if cracked at the right place, which is the area where their limbs are joint to their shell. This means, you can break their arms and legs if you crack that area. You can also blind the Air Conditioners if you crack their front panel on the right spot. Still, you can't disconnect or rip them off, that's gore and this ain't gore.


Death and injury is not permanent, unless their source of recovery/repair is unusable. Until the source of recovery/repair is usable again, the Air Conditioners can't be brought back to life.  
This source of recovery/repair can replace the electronics control module with all they have back. Their soul are reinjected into this new module.  
With injuries, the source of recovery/repair can repair or replace their damaged parts. Somehow, this source can skin them alive if needed to replace the damaged parts.
