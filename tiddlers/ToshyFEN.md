ToshyFEN, a contestant. His name is pronounced as Toh-she-Fen. His name is unique, and is like ToshyRAVi and ToshyMem.

He is a Toshiba RAV-RM561FT-EN. ToshyFEN is a floor standing AC unlike most of his fellow people. He is male. Born in 2021. A british AC.

He can speak due to him not natively having a beep like his fellow people. He also has a beep, though its a composite beep.

ToshyFEN also has two faces. One in his main body and the other in his remote controller.


[TBA detailed personality for ToshyFEN]
[TLDR - ToshyFEN is WellPAN, but more active and has a bit of JVXH, MHeLy and ZSRK. He is quite chill, but can be unhinged and angered at times.]


ToshyFEN is notable for being damaged. Though not mentally damaged (damaged logic board). In where the crotch is, there is a missing piece of his shell. The piece seems to be broken off like it was destroyed. If ToshyFEN were to get a new shell, it would always have that hole. It does not impact him though (No pain or adverse side effects).  
ToshyFEN is also more durable than his fellow people btw, and that the fact he is still fine proves that fact. This is because most of his fellow people AKA ACs would get incapacitated by pain and probably screaming the moment their crotch is broken off just like a crotch kick.
